# Exercise 01

## Demonstration of Rational Rose98, ARGOUML and IBMRSA tools

### Aim  

To demonstrate the usage of Rational Rose98, ArgoUML, and IBM RSA tools for Object-Oriented Analysis and Design.

### Theory

- **Rational Rose98** is a software modeling tool used for object-oriented design and analysis. It supports Unified Modeling Language (UML) and allows users to create, visualize, and document system models.
  
- **ArgoUML** is an open-source UML modeling tool that provides features for creating UML diagrams such as use case, class, sequence, and activity diagrams. It is a widely used tool for object-oriented modeling.

- **IBM RSA (Rational Software Architect)** is a tool for software design and development that integrates with UML for modeling and generates code. It assists with the design of object-oriented systems, focusing on architecture and structure.

These tools help in creating and refining models, ensuring proper system structure and behavior, which is essential for designing object-oriented software systems.

### Procedure/Program

1. **Rational Rose98**:
   - Launch Rational Rose98 and create a new project.
   - Select the appropriate model type (e.g., use case, class diagram, sequence diagram).
   - Use the toolbox to add elements like classes, objects, actors, and associations.
   - Organize the diagram and generate the documentation for the project.
   - Explore the code generation feature to convert the UML models to source code.

2. **ArgoUML**:
   - Download and install ArgoUML from the official website.
   - Open ArgoUML and create a new project.
   - Use the diagram options to create various UML diagrams:
     - Class diagram: Add classes and define their attributes and methods.
     - Use case diagram: Define actors and their relationships with use cases.
     - Sequence diagram: Add objects and define message exchanges between them.
   - Save and export the diagrams in various formats (e.g., PNG, SVG).

3. **IBM RSA (Rational Software Architect)**:
   - Launch IBM RSA and create a new project.
   - Choose the appropriate UML diagram type (e.g., class diagram, component diagram).
   - Add classes, interfaces, and components to the diagram.
   - Define relationships between components using associations and dependencies.
   - Use the model validation feature to check the consistency of the design.
   - Explore the code generation option to generate skeleton code from the model.

### Output/Explanation

- **Rational Rose98**: The output will be a comprehensive UML diagram with detailed system modeling. The code generation feature will generate skeleton code based on the UML design.
  
- **ArgoUML**: The output will include various UML diagrams, such as class, use case, and sequence diagrams, representing different aspects of the system.
  
- **IBM RSA**: The output will be a validated UML model representing the software architecture, and it will also include generated code that can be used for implementation.

Explanation:

- Rational Rose98, ArgoUML, and IBM RSA are essential tools for visualizing, documenting, and analyzing object-oriented systems.
- These tools help in creating UML diagrams that represent the structure and behavior of the system, assisting in efficient system design.
- By generating skeleton code from UML models, these tools streamline the development process and ensure that the system's design is aligned with the intended architecture.
